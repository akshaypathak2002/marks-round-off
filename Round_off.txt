We are given grades of the students 
We have to round of the grades . 
1.If the difference between the grade  and the next multiple of 5   is less than ,3  round  up to the next multiple of 5 .
2. If the value of grade is less than 38 , no rounding occurs as the result will still be a failing grade.
